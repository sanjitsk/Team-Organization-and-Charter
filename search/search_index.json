This involves interfacing the ESP32 with the sensors and ensuring real-time data updates. The third teammate will design the user interface, selecting fonts, colors, and layouts to make the LCD display intuitive and easy to read. The fourth teammate will test and calibrate the system, running it under various conditions to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p> <p>Internet-based two-way communication is integrated into the system, allowing it to receive updates and send data to remote servers for further analysis or display on a web interface. This feature enables continuous monitoring and provides visitors with up-to-date information.</p> <p>The human-machine interface is achieved through a combination of the LCD screen and user-friendly buttons. The interface is designed with cues such as clear labels and color-coded buttons to guide visitors. For instance, buttons are used to switch between different data displays or reset the sensors. According to the \"Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits,\" controls are designed to be straightforward, with minimal steps required for interaction. Buttons are large and responsive, ensuring that visitors of all ages and abilities can engage with the system without confusion.</p> <p>Durability is a key consideration in the design, as the system must withstand frequent use and potential environmental factors. High-quality components and robust construction ensure longevity, and the system is enclosed in a sturdy case to protect it from physical damage. Safety is prioritized by properly insulating electrical components and securely mounting sensors to prevent any accidents. Comfort is addressed through the ergonomic design of controls and the portable structure of the system, making it easy for visitors to handle and interact with.</p> <p>Instructions for using the device are simple and clear, as recommended on page 5 of the \"Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits.\" Visitors are guided through powering on the system, reading data on the LCD display, and interpreting weather information. Troubleshooting tips and maintenance guidelines are provided to ensure the system remains in good working condition.</p> <p>Overall, the weather monitoring system enhances the museum experience by providing an interactive and educational exhibit.
