Group text reminders.

Face to face is ideal for most situations however for assignments that are already mentioned late night hours is what works for most individuals however hours to meet is the forefront of this meeting creation.

Team Coordination & Accountability
---

Assignment Deadlines: Establish clear deadlines for each assignment and communicate them to all team members.

Progress Checkpoints: Implement intermediate checkpoints to review progress and ensure tasks are on track.
Final Review: Schedule a final review meeting before the submission deadline where each team member reviews and "signs off" on the assignment.

Knowledge and Skill Requirements: Conduct an initial assessment to identify each team member's strengths and areas for improvement. For this situation it will be a simple team interview. 

Training and Resources: Provide necessary training and resources to fill any knowledge gaps.

Mentorship: Pair less experienced members with mentors who can guide them through the assignment.

Feedback Distribution and Action: Use Google Drive  to collect and distribute feedback from design reviews.

Action Plan: Develop a clear action plan based on the feedback, assigning specific tasks to team members to address the feedback.

Follow-Up Meetings: Schedule follow-up meetings to ensure feedback has been acted upon and improvements have been made.
Addressing Missed Contributions and Accountability

Missed Contributions: Address missed contributions immediately through direct communication with the involved team member.

Root Cause Analysis: Identify the reasons for the missed contribution and provide support to resolve any issues.

Reassignment: If necessary, reassign tasks to ensure project continuity.

Accountability: Clearly define and communicate expectations for each team member.

Regular Check-Ins: Hold regular check-in meetings to monitor progress and address any issues early.

Peer Accountability: Encourage team members to hold each other accountable through open and respectful communication.

Recognizing and Addressing Underperformance: Regularly monitor each team member's performance against set expectations.

Support and Improvement Plan: If a team member is underperforming, provide constructive feedback and develop a support plan to help them improve.

Consequences: If there is no improvement despite support, the team must consider implementing consequences such as reassigning tasks or, in extreme cases, issuing a "pink slip" to remove the team member from the project.
