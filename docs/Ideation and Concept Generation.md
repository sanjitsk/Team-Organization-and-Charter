## **Objective**
The purpose of this assignment is to generate innovative design features for our product and present alternative versions that align with the project requirements. This brainstorming process is aimed at ensuring that we develop a solution that is both effective and adaptable.

## **Project Description**
This project involves designing a modular system that utilizes UART communication between independently developed subsystems. Each team member is responsible for creating a surface-mount PCB, and the integrated system must function seamlessly for the Innovation Showcase. Key considerations include individual contributions, collaborative teamwork, and strict adherence to technical requirements such as microcontroller specifications, ECAD tool usage, and the daisy-chain communication protocol. Success will be defined by effective planning, thorough testing, and compliance with integration and documentation standards.

## **Science Exhibit Intentions**

### **1. Exhibit Goal**
The weather monitoring system is designed to illustrate meteorological data collection principles. It aims to teach students how environmental sensors work, highlight scientific measurement processes, and facilitate an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships in weather systems. Through interactive and hands-on experiences, students will gain insights into how atmospheric data is collected, analyzed, and visualized.

### **2. Target Audience**
The exhibit is intended for K-12 students, encompassing a wide age range (approximately 6-16 years) and diverse learning needs. The design must accommodate different learning styles, physical capabilities, and levels of scientific understanding. The system must be accessible for young learners while offering a more in-depth, engaging experience for high school students.

## **Key Design Considerations**

### **1. How will we make the device easy to use?**
We will incorporate visual cues as a primary guiding tool. A well-structured, visually appealing design will attract students and sustain their interest. Additionally, tactile cues will be included—such as textured buttons and handles—to enhance accessibility for younger users and those with visual impairments.

### **2. Designing Interactive Controls**
Controls will be designed for simplicity, ensuring intuitive interactions with minimal explanation. Large push buttons and a touchscreen interface featuring drag-and-drop functionalities will allow users to easily navigate through the system.

### **3. Durability, Safety, and Comfort**
Durability, safety, and comfort are crucial considerations. The product will be constructed using robust materials that can withstand frequent use and potential misuse. Safety features such as emergency stop buttons and well-insulated electrical components will be integrated to meet necessary safety standards.

### **4. Instructional Design**
We will provide concise, on-device instructions using diagrams and short phrases located next to control elements. Interactive tutorials will also be available to guide students through system operation and enhance learning.

### **5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Science Exhibits**
To ensure effectiveness, we will:
- Avoid information overload by presenting concise, digestible content.
- Actively collect feedback to refine usability.
- Gain insights into user needs to tailor functionality effectively.
- Maintain conceptual consistency across all design elements.
- Design an experience that captures and sustains interest through interactive engagement.

## **Brainstorming Process**

[**EGR 314 Ideation Slides**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-jR1jT5JZCxH_XFAIzBFzMHgu-b0iQvdZxi1QXmcdSc/edit)

1. Our team categorized ideas into **Physics & Engineering**, **Chemistry & Material Science**, **Biology & Life Sciences**, and **Earth & Space Science**.
2. Each idea was ranked as **High, Medium, or Low priority** based on feasibility and project alignment.
3. The refined selection of ideas was documented in **Figure 1.2: Remaining Brainstormed Ideas**.
4. The top concepts, grouped by category, are showcased in **Figure 1.7: Snapshot of all Categories**.

## **Categorizing Our Brainstormed Ideas**

To organize our 100 ideas effectively, we grouped them into four major categories:
- **Physics & Engineering**
- **Chemistry & Material Science**
- **Biology & Life Sciences**
- **Earth & Space Science**

Highly rated ideas are marked with ***
Moderately considered ideas are marked with **
Least prioritized ideas are marked with *

## **Final Design Selection Process**
Our decision-making process involved evaluating the best ideas from our brainstorming session based on feasibility, impact, and modularity. After discussions with stakeholders and additional research, we refined our concept to incorporate:
- **A highly interactive weather monitoring system**
- **Intuitive control mechanisms for accessibility**
- **A visually engaging and scientifically informative experience**

If deviations from our initial concept occurred, they were driven by insights gained from testing, research, and expert recommendations.
